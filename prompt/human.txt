Describe the image in a compact and precise style, similar to BLIP or WD image captioning models. List clearly visible elements only, using short descriptive phrases separated by commas. Focus on main subjects, visible objects, environment, lighting, color palette, mood, artistic style, facial expressions (if present), and background. Do not repeat phrases, and do not include elements that are hidden or not visible in the image. Ensure the result is unique, varied, and visually grounded.
